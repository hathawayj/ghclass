## Who is this package for?

This package is for everyone! But really, if you're an instructor who uses 
GitHub for your class management, e.g. students submit assignments via GitHub 
repos, this package is definitely for you! The package also assumes that you're 
and R user, and you probably teach R as well, though that's not a requirement 
since this package is all about setting up repositories with the right 
permissions, not what your students put in those repositories. (If you're a 
Python user, see [this post](https://ubc-mds.github.io/2017-08-24-teaching-with-github/) for a Python 
based alternative.)

## What is this vignette about?

This vignette is about the nitty-gritty of setting your class up in GitHub with 
ghclass. For a higher level discussion of why and how to use Git/GitHub in data 
science education, see [this paper](https://peerj.com/preprints/3181/) by the 
package authors.

## Structuring your class on GitHub

The general framework is outlined below. This is not the only way to structure 
a class on GitHub, but it's a good way, and one that ghclass is optimized to 
work with.

We outline steps for achieving this structure in the next section. This section 
is meant to give a high level view of what your course looks like on GitHub.

- One organization per class: If you teach at a university, this means one 
semester of a given course. If you teach workshops, this would be one workshop. 
The instructor and any additional instructional staff, e.g. teaching assistants, 
are owners. Going forward we will refer to this group of people as "instructors". 
The students are members.

- One repo per student (or team) per assignment: The instructors have admin 
access to repos, i.e. they can read, clone, push, and add collaborators to 
assignment repositories as well as delete them. The students have write access 
to repo, which means that they can read, clone, and push to this repository but 
they cannot delete them and they cannot add others to them. This can help with 
minimizing accidents that cannot be undone and makes sure students cannot peek 
into each others' repositories unless you explicitly allow them to do so.

If you have a teamwork component to your course, you can also set up teams on 
GitHub and give them access to repositories for team assignments.

Suppose you have 48 students in your class, and they are in 12 teams of 4 
students each. Suppose also that students turn in the following throughout 
a semester:

- Individual: 10 homework assignments + 2 exams
- Teamwork: 8 lab assignments + 1 project

Then, throughout the semester you will need to create total of

```{r repos}
repo_indiv <- 10 + 2
repo_team <- 8 + 1
48 * repo_indiv + 12 * repo_team
```

That is a lot of repos to create and set permissions to manually! It's 
also a lot of repos to clone when it comes time to grading. ghclass addresses 
this problem, and more! It does not, however, address the problem that that's a 
lot of grading. Sorry, you're on your own there!

That being said, ghclass does also facilitates setting up continuous integration 
for students' assignment repos, which means that some of the checking and 
feedback giving can be done automatically each time they push to the repo 
without intervention from the instructors.

## Authentication

This package uses tokens for authentication with both [wercker](https://app.wercker.com/profile/tokens) and [github](https://github.com/settings/tokens), these values can be supplied via environmental variables `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `WERCKER_TOKEN` respectively or in `~/.github/token` and `~/.wercker/token`.

Alternative token locations can be specified with `set_github_token` or `set_wercker_token`.

## Step-by-step guide

Start with creating an organization on GitHub for the course. We recommend 
using the course number, semester/quarter, and year in the organization name, 
e.g. for a course numbered Sta 199 in Spring 18, you can use `Sta199-Sp18`.

Then go [here](https://education.github.com/discount_requests/new) to apply 
for GitHub Education discount for unlimited private repositories. This is an 
optional step, but one that many will want to do. GitHub charges for private 
repositories unless they are used for teaching purposes. The application for 
GitHub Education discount requires that you submit a course syllabus and/or 
a link to the course homepage. Make sure you have (at least a draft of) a 
syllabus ready at this point. Approval is usually pretty quick, but you don't 
want to do this the night before classes begin. Give yourself at least a week 
to be safe.

### Adding students and creating teams

Next, you should collect your students' GitHub user names. You can do this with 
a Google form and then read the spreadsheet containing their responses into R 
using the **googlesheets** package. The resulting data frame should include two 
columns: one called `github` which contains students' GitHub user names and a column called `team` that contains the team 
name for each student.

For example your roster file might look something like the following:

```csv
github,team
Alice,Team1
Bob,Team2
Carol,Team3
Dave,Team4
Eve,Team5
```

Using the `roster` data frame we can then invite the students to class' organzation as well as create and add them to their teams. 

```r
invite_user("Sta523-Fa17", roster$github)

## Adding Alice to Sta523-Fa17 ...
## Adding Bob to Sta523-Fa17 ...
## Adding Carol to Sta523-Fa17 ...
## Adding Dave to Sta523-Fa17 ...
## Adding Eve to Sta523-Fa17 ...
```

```r
create_team("Sta523-Fa17", unique(roster$team))

## Adding Team1 ...
## Adding Team2 ...
## Adding Team3 ...
## Adding Team4 ...
## Adding Team5 ...
```
 
```r
add_team_member("Sta523-Fa17", roster$github, roster$team)

## Adding Alice to Team1 ...
## Adding Bob to Team2 ...
## Adding Carol to Team3 ...
## Adding Dave to Team4 ...
## Adding Eve to Team5 ...
```

### Creating a team assignment

First you create repositories for each team with a prefix identifying the 
assignment. The resulting repo names will be this prefix followed by the 
team name.

```r
create_team_repos("Sta523-Fa17", prefix="hw2-")

## Creating hw2-Team01 for Team01 ...
## Creating hw2-Team02 for Team02 ...
## Creating hw2-Team03 for Team03 ...
## Creating hw2-Team04 for Team04 ...
## Creating hw2-Team05 for Team05 ...
```

If you want to place starter docs into the assignment repos that you just 
created, you should first create a repo in this organization containing these 
starter docs and then mirrow the contents of that repo to the repos you created 
earlier. You can do this with the `mirror_repo` function.

```r
mirror_repo(
  source_repo = "Sta523-Fa17/hw2", 
  target_repos = get_repos("Sta523-Fa17","hw2-")
  )

## Cloning source repo (Sta523-Fa17/hw2) ...
## Mirroring Sta523-Fa17/hw2 to Sta523-Fa17/hw2-Team01 ...
## Mirroring Sta523-Fa17/hw2 to Sta523-Fa17/hw2-Team02 ...
## Mirroring Sta523-Fa17/hw2 to Sta523-Fa17/hw2-Team03 ...
## Mirroring Sta523-Fa17/hw2 to Sta523-Fa17/hw2-Team04 ...
## Mirroring Sta523-Fa17/hw2 to Sta523-Fa17/hw2-Team05 ...
## Cleaning up ...
```

### Creating an individual assignment

The process for creating an individual assignment is very similar to that for
creating a team assignment, but uses the `create_individual_assignment()` 
function instead.

### Adding Wercker badges to repos

Before running the following step(s) involving Wercker make sure you've done the following:

* If you do not have one already create an account with Wercker 

* Create an organization with Wercker that will contain all of your apps for this class

* Create and save a Wercker [token](https://app.wercker.com/profile/tokens) to `~/.wercker/token`

* Make sure third party access is allowed for your github organization (See Settings / Third-party access then click on remote restrictions)

```r
add_wercker(get_repos("Sta523-Fa17", "hw2-"), "Sta523-Fa17")

## Creating wercker app for Sta523-Fa17/hw2-Team01 ...
## Creating wercker app for Sta523-Fa17/hw2-Team02 ...
## Creating wercker app for Sta523-Fa17/hw2-Team03 ...
## Creating wercker app for Sta523-Fa17/hw2-Team04 ...
## Creating wercker app for Sta523-Fa17/hw2-Team05 ...
```

### Modifying repos

You can also modify repos afer they have been created. This will overwrite 
existing files with the same name in the repo so you should be careful not to
do this if students have already started working on the repos.

```r
add_files(
  get_repos("Sta523-Fa17","hw2-"), 
  message = "Remove wrong wercker badge", 
  files = "~/Desktop/Sta523/Homework/hw2/repo/README.md"
)

## Adding files to Sta523-Fa17/hw2-Team01 ...
## Adding files to Sta523-Fa17/hw2-Team02 ...
## Adding files to Sta523-Fa17/hw2-Team03 ...
## Adding files to Sta523-Fa17/hw2-Team04 ...
## Adding files to Sta523-Fa17/hw2-Team05 ...
```

## FAQ

1. Do I really need private repositories for my students' assignments? I don't 
care if they see each others' work.

You might not care, but the law might. For example, in the United States, FERPA 
regulations stipulate that student information should be kept private. If you 
use public repositories, anyone can find out who is enrolled in your course. 
Additionally, you will likely be using GitHub issues for providing feedback 
on the students' work, and potentially even mention their grade in a given 
assignment. This information should not be publicly available to anyone.

Also, your students may not want their coursework to be publicly available. 
They are bound to make mistakes as they learn and it should be up to them 
whether they want those to be a piece of their public profile on GitHub.

2. Why not use [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/)?

At some level this is a matter of preference, but there are a few 
functionalities here that are not present in GitHub Classroom:

- Pre-defined teams -- as opposed to relying on students to pick their team when 
creating their assignment repo.
- Command-line interface -- if you like writing R code to solve your problems 
this may be a better fit for you as it provides a greater level of control and
more flexibility.
- Actually you don't have to choose between ghclass and [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/), your workflow might involve using both.
