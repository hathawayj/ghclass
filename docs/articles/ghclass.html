<p>This package is for everyone! But really, if you’re an instructor who uses GitHub for your class management, e.g. students submit assignments via GitHub repos, this package is definitely for you! The package also assumes that you’re and R user, and you probably teach R as well, though that’s not a requirement since this package is all about setting up repositories with the right permissions, not what your students put in those repositories. (If you’re a Python user, see <a href="https://ubc-mds.github.io/2017-08-24-teaching-with-github/">this post</a> for a Python based alternative.)</p>
</div>
<div id="what-is-this-vignette-about" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#what-is-this-vignette-about" class="anchor"></a>What is this vignette about?</h2>
<p>This vignette is about the nitty-gritty of setting your class up in GitHub with ghclass. For a higher level discussion of why and how to use Git/GitHub in data science education, see <a href="https://peerj.com/preprints/3181/">this paper</a> by the package authors.</p>
</div>
<div id="structuring-your-class-on-github" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#structuring-your-class-on-github" class="anchor"></a>Structuring your class on GitHub</h2>
<p>The general framework is outlined below. This is not the only way to structure a class on GitHub, but it’s a good way, and one that ghclass is optimized to work with.</p>
<p>We outline steps for achieving this structure in the next section. This section is meant to give a high level view of what your course looks like on GitHub.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>One organization per class: If you teach at a university, this means one semester of a given course. If you teach workshops, this would be one workshop. The instructor and any additional instructional staff, e.g. teaching assistants, are owners. Going forward we will refer to this group of people as “instructors”. The students are members.</p></li>
<li><p>One repo per student (or team) per assignment: The instructors have admin access to repos, i.e. they can read, clone, push, and add collaborators to assignment repositories as well as delete them. The students have write access to repo, which means that they can read, clone, and push to this repository but they cannot delete them and they cannot add others to them. This can help with minimizing accidents that cannot be undone and makes sure students cannot peek into each others’ repositories unless you explicitly allow them to do so.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you have a teamwork component to your course, you can also set up teams on GitHub and give them access to repositories for team assignments.</p>
<p>Suppose you have 48 students in your class, and they are in 12 teams of 4 students each. Suppose also that students turn in the following throughout a semester:</p>
<ul>
<li>Individual: 10 homework assignments + 2 exams</li>
<li>Teamwork: 8 lab assignments + 1 project</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, throughout the semester you will need to create total of</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">repo_indiv &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="dv">10</span> <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="dv">2</span>
repo_team &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="dv">8</span> <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="dv">1</span>
<span class="dv">48</span> <span class="op">*</span><span class="st"> </span>repo_indiv <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="dv">12</span> <span class="op">*</span><span class="st"> </span>repo_team
<span class="co">#&gt; [1] 684</span></code></pre></div>
<p>That is a lot of repos to create and set permissions to manually! It’s also a lot of repos to clone when it comes time to grading. ghclass addresses this problem, and more! It does not, however, address the problem that that’s a lot of grading. Sorry, you’re on your own there!</p>
<p>That being said, ghclass does also facilitates setting up continuous integration for students’ assignment repos, which means that some of the checking and feedback giving can be done automatically each time they push to the repo without intervention from the instructors.</p>
</div>
<div id="authentication" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#authentication" class="anchor"></a>Authentication</h2>
<p>This package uses tokens for authentication with both <a href="https://app.wercker.com/profile/tokens">wercker</a> and <a href="https://github.com/settings/tokens">github</a>, these values can be supplied via environmental variables <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code> and <code>WERCKER_TOKEN</code> respectively or in <code>~/.github/token</code> and <code>~/.wercker/token</code>.</p>
<p>Alternative token locations can be specified with <code>set_github_token</code> or <code>set_wercker_token</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="step-by-step-guide" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#step-by-step-guide" class="anchor"></a>Step-by-step guide</h2>
<p>Start with creating an organization on GitHub for the course. We recommend using the course number, semester/quarter, and year in the organization name, e.g. for a course numbered Sta 199 in Spring 18, you can use <code>Sta199-Sp18</code>.</p>
<p>Then go <a href="https://education.github.com/discount_requests/new">here</a> to apply for GitHub Education discount for unlimited private repositories. This is an optional step, but one that many will want to do. GitHub charges for private repositories unless they are used for teaching purposes. The application for GitHub Education discount requires that you submit a course syllabus and/or a link to the course homepage. Make sure you have (at least a draft of) a syllabus ready at this point. Approval is usually pretty quick, but you don’t want to do this the night before classes begin. Give yourself at least a week to be safe.</p>

<a href="#adding-students-and-creating-teams" class="anchor"></a>Adding students and creating teams</h3>
<p>Next, you should collect your students’ GitHub user names. You can do this with a Google form and then read the spreadsheet containing their responses into R using the <strong>googlesheets</strong> package. The resulting data frame should include two columns: one called <code>github</code> which contains students’ GitHub user names and a column called <code>team</code> that contains the team name for each student.</p>
<p>For example your roster file might look something like the following:</p>
<pre class="csv"><code>github,team
Alice,Team1
Bob,Team2
Carol,Team3
Dave,Team4
Eve,Team5</code></pre>
<p>Using the <code>roster</code> data frame we can then invite the students to class’ organzation as well as create and add them to their teams.</p>

<p>First you create repositories for each team with a prefix identifying the assignment. The resulting repo names will be this prefix followed by the team name.</p>

<p>If you want to place starter docs into the assignment repos that you just created, you should first create a repo in this organization containing these starter docs and then mirrow the contents of that repo to the repos you created earlier. You can do this with the <code>mirror_repo</code> function.</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Do I really need private repositories for my students’ assignments? I don’t care if they see each others’ work.</li>
</ol>
<p>You might not care, but the law might. For example, in the United States, FERPA regulations stipulate that student information should be kept private. If you use public repositories, anyone can find out who is enrolled in your course. Additionally, you will likely be using GitHub issues for providing feedback on the students’ work, and potentially even mention their grade in a given assignment. This information should not be publicly available to anyone.</p>
<p>Also, your students may not want their coursework to be publicly available. They are bound to make mistakes as they learn and it should be up to them whether they want those to be a piece of their public profile on GitHub.</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Why not use <a href="https://classroom.github.com/">GitHub Classroom</a>?</li>
</ol>
<p>At some level this is a matter of preference, but there are a few functionalities here that are not present in GitHub Classroom:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pre-defined teams – as opposed to relying on students to pick their team when creating their assignment repo.</li>
<li>Command-line interface – if you like writing R code to solve your problems this may be a better fit for you as it provides a greater level of control and more flexibility.</li>
<li>Actually you don’t have to choose between ghclass and <a href="https://classroom.github.com/">GitHub Classroom</a>, your workflow might involve using both.</li>
