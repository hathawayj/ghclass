## Tools for managing github class organization accounts

This package is for everyone! But really, if you're an instructor who uses 
GitHub for your class management, e.g. students submit assignments via GitHub 
repos, this package is definitely for you! The package also assumes that you're 
and R user, and you probably teach R as well, though that's not a requirement 
since this package is all about setting up repositories with the right 
permissions, not what your students put in those repositories. 

See package vignette for details on how to use the package.
